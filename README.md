# Semantic Segmentation Project

This repository provides a simple setup to experiment with semantic segmentation models. It includes:
- Data loading utilities
- Model definitions
- Training and evaluation scripts
- Example notebooks

## Features
1. Customizable data pipeline for segmentation.
2. Modular model design to fit various use cases.
3. Comprehensive training loop with validation and logging.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies from requirements.txt.
3. Prepare your dataset and update config files.
4. Run the training script.

## Model Description
A U-Net-based architecture is used to handle multi-class segmentation. Encoders learn feature representations, while decoders reconstruct segmentation masks for each class.

## Contributing
Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests to improve features.
